Module 4

Attached in Starter Code 6 you will find the "pycityschool_starter"

I had some issues with the coding for some of the "school by" sections toward the bottom. It was difficult to draw conclusions due to this. I am hoping to gain some insight to where I went wrong or how to appraoch, so I can verify my analysis is still correct and all is completed properly.
